# Rough Idea

We need to clone the /home/coder/openchamber features into our current react-native app. The integration with coder workspaces is almost done, and we have now a direct connection to the running opencode instance there, we need to make our UI and support all the features from there. Also we need to take a look at /home/coder/opencode/packages/destkop where they have an official desktop app, this can show us how to use the SDK and how to integrate the frontend to the opencode server, our app has its own component system that we should always utilize.
