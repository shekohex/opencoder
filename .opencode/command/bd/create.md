Create a new beads issue. If arguments are provided:

- $3: Priority (0-4, where 0=critical, 4=backlog)

If arguments are missing, ask the user for:

2. Issue type (default: task)
3. Priority (default: 2)
4. Description (optional)

Use the `bd create` command to create the issue. Show the created issue ID and details to the user.

Optionally ask if this issue should be linked to another issue (discovered-from, blocks, parent-child, related).
