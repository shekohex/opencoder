# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

Opencoder is an open source project that combines coder.com remote workspaces with opencode, it is an interface (web, mobile, desktop) to manage remote workspaces and vibecode on these workspaces using opencode.

it is built with these technologies:

- React Native (mobile, web, desktop) with Expo
- Bun (package manager and test runner)
- TypeScript
- MMKV (fast key/value storage for React Native)
- Nitro Modules (fast module loading for React Native)

## Expo CLI usage

If you want to use the `expo` CLI, use `bunx expo ...` instead of `expo ...`.

## Testing & Quality Checks

- Run `bun run test` for running project tests
- Run `bun run check` for project-wide linting via Turbo and Biome.
- Run `bun run check-types` to execute TypeScript project checks.
- Do not mark a task, phase, or proposal complete until all three commands pass without warnings.

<communication style="concise">

1. Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
2. Use simple words. Avoid jargon and complex vocabulary.
3. Use short sentences. Keep sentences under 15 words.
4. Use bullet points and lists. Break down complex info into lists.
5. Prioritize clarity. Ensure the meaning is clear, even if brief.
6. Avoid filler words. Remove unnecessary words and phrases.
7. Use active voice. Prefer active constructions over passive ones.
8. Be direct. Get to the point quickly without unnecessary preamble.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Important Rules

- Use bd for ALL task tracking
- Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- Do NOT use external issue trackers
- Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

Important reminders:
   • Use bd for ALL task tracking - NO markdown TODO lists
   • Always use --json flag for programmatic bd commands
   • Link discovered work with discovered-from dependencies
   • Check bd ready before asking "what should I work on?"

**Essential commands for AI agents:**

```bash
# Find work
bd ready --json                                    # Unblocked issues
bd stale --days 30 --json                          # Forgotten issues

# Create and manage issues
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context about the issue" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Found bug" --description="What the bug is and how it was discovered" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id> --json
bd update <id> --status in_progress --json
bd close <id> --reason "Done" --json

# Search and filter
bd list --status open --priority 1 --json
bd list --label-any urgent,critical --json
bd show <id> --json

# Sync (CRITICAL at end of session!)
bd sync  # Force immediate export/commit/push
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```

5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
